## Roadmap

Hey there, everyone! Today, we're thrilled to unveil the 2024 roadmap for Effect.AI. This year is going to be nothing short of groundbreaking, packed with progress and achievements. We're eager to share our plans with all of you.

Let's dive right in. As many of you may have already gathered, we're embarking on an exciting journey to bridge with the Solana ecosystem. This pivotal move highlights our commitment to enhancing both <u>developer</u> and <u>general user experiences</u>. Solana's ecosystem promises robust support for developers, making it a great fit for our future goals.

In a couple of weeks, our workforce can anticipate the long-awaited **V2 release**, significantly boosting their experience on the platform. Meanwhile, our DAO will play an increasingly pivotal role, stepping up as the primary ecosystem maintainer.

We're also doubling down on our commitment to developers, aiming to streamline their journey with the platform. Expect significant DX updates to our SDK, enabling developers to harness the power of our workforce with just three to five lines of code. Furthermore, we're forging new partnerships with some very exciting Solana projects looking to leverage our platform for tasks.

Looking ahead, we're excited to launch a series of ambitious long-term growth initiatives that will propel Effect.AI to new heights. Stay tuned for an exhilarating journey ahead as we chart the course for Effect.AI's evolution in 2024.

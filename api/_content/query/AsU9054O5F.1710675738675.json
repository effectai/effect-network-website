In Staking Protocol 2.0, the existing limit of 200 days Stake AGE will be increased and the role of Stake AGE will become even more important and powerful. With the parameters outlined in the graph from the previous section, it shows that Stake AGE can double your EFX power by adding the initially staked tokens to your EFX power after 200 days of Stake AGE. This means, for example, that someone with 100k staked tokens with a year of Stake AGE has more EFX Power than someone who recently staked 200k EFX. The limit will be set in such a way that early and long-term members will greatly benefit from having staked their tokens longer.

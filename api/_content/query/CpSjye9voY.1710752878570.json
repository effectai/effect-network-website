By using an exponential function to determine the minimum requirement of EFX Power, it will be easier for newcomers with lower rankings to participate in the DAO. It will, however, take longer if you want to participate with higher levels of DAO ranking. As your EFX Power increases over time due to Stake AGE (more on this later), and to keep things fair, there is an exponential increase in requirement for EFX (shown with the red line).

However, The Effect Staking Protocol includes a measurement feature to track how long your stake has been active. This feature is called Stake AGE.

The generation of NFX tokens will stop at one point if we switch over to the new version, but staking will continue, as well as Stake AGE. In Staking Protocol 2.0, the existing limit of 200 days Stake AGE will be increased and the role of Stake AGE will become even more important and powerful. With the parameters outlined in the graph from the previous section, it shows that Stake AGE can double your EFX power by adding the initially staked tokens to your EFX power after 200 days of Stake AGE. This means, for example, that someone with 100k staked tokens with a year of Stake AGE has more EFX Power than someone who recently staked 200k EFX. The limit will be set in such a way that early and long-term members will greatly benefit from having staked their tokens longer. Also, it will make the Stake AGE not too powerful, as it still needs to be beneficial to stake more EFX as well. Such a parameter is a great example of something that can be controlled by DAO governance voting proposals."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"img","props":{"alt":"","src":"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/0*cnSX-wam1SSSoVa2"},"children":[]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Stake AGE has several benefits over regular staking:"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Users will be incentivized to keep their tokens staked for a longer time.\nEarly and long-term participants are rewarded.\nIt will be harder for new members with a lot of tokens to immediately take big rewards or votes from the DAO.\nThe penalty for unstaking will be bigger as users will lose their Stake AGE for their unstaked tokens, making sure users are incentivized to keep their tokens staked."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"voting-allocations-and-fee-rewards"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Voting Allocations and Fee Rewards"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"There are four major stages that play an important role in the Effect DAO.
